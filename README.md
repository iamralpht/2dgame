GTA 1 inspired car game using Box2D
===================================

This borrows a few tiles and car images from the original GTA game, but implements the physics with Box2D based on this model: https://github.com/domasx2/gamejs-box2d-car-example

I wrote it in 2010, then redid the model in 2013 to work against Box2D 2.2.1. Change the BOX2D path in the Makefile to point to your Box2D installation. The one in Ubuntu 12.10 is too old, so you need to build from source.
